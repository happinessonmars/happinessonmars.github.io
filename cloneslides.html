# Introduction
<br>
  <br>
 
<h4>Might happiness on Mars be gained in the same way as on Earth?<br>
  Here is an insight about a research on the "pursuit of happiness" on Mars<br>
  according to different cultural perspectives on human conditions,<br>
  habitats, identities, cultures, social representations and objects.<br><br><br>
The pursuit of happiness is at the basis of the foundation of modern<br> 
  Constitutions as the right to live in conditions worth for a living as<br>
  modern humans. In the case of a martian colony what might be transferred<br>
  from Earth as rights, duties and values given individual, social, cultural<br>
  and psychological requirements?

# GOALS 
<br>
  <br>
 <center>
<h4>To sketch a primer design for martian happy practices and habitats<br> 
based and compared with eartlike examples and best practices on happiness report<br>
  with a list of features to be included in the design of the habitat.
   This conceptual exploration engages with those<br>
  social environments that represent virtuous and non virtuous cases of happy communities on Earth.<br>
  As result we like to discuss some of the features about emotional/social/cultural<br>
  conditions in such extreme environment.</h4>

# ANTHROPOLOGY OF HAPPINESS (IN SPACE)

  Among the core elements of the frontier myth was the powerful sense among
certain groups of Americans that wilderness was the last bastion of rugged individualism. Turner tended to stress communitarian themes when writing frontier history,
asserting that Americans in primitive conditions had been forced to band together
with their neighbors to form communities and democratic institutions (a href"https://faculty.washington.edu/timbillo/Readings%20and%20documents/Wilderness/Cronon%20The%20trouble%20with%20Wilderness.pdf">Cronon,1996</a>)
