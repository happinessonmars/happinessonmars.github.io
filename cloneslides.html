# Introduction
<br>
  <br>
 
<h4>Might happiness on Mars be gained in the same way as on Earth?<br>
  Here is an insight about a research on the "pursuit of happiness" on Mars
  according to different cultural perspectives on human conditions,
  habitats, identities, cultures, social representations and objects.<br><br><br>
The pursuit of happiness is at the basis of the foundation of modern
  Constitutions as the right to live in conditions worth for a living as
  modern humans. In the case of a martian colony what might be transferred
  from Earth as rights, duties and values given individual, social, cultural<br>
  and psychological requirements? 
</h4>

# GOALS 
<br>
  <br>

<h4>To sketch a primer insight about martian happy practices and habitats
based and compared with earthling examples of best practices and happiness studies
  with a list of features to be included in the design of the habitat.
  <br><br>
   This conceptual exploration engages with those
  social environments that represent virtuous and
  non virtuous cases of happy communities on Earth.<br>
  As result we like to discuss some of the features
  about emotional/social/cultural
  conditions in such extreme environment.</h4>

# ANTHROPOLOGY OF HAPPINESS (IN SPACE)

  
"Among the core elements of the frontier myth was the powerful sense among
certain groups of Americans that wilderness was the last bastion of rugged individualism. 
  Turner tended to stress communitarian themes when writing frontier history,
asserting that Americans in primitive conditions had been forced to band together
with their neighbors to form communities and democratic institutions" 
  <br><center>(Cronon,1996)
